This CPU python script generates random hex for puzzle 73 with secrets

and performs binary transformations inversion, reverse, binary shift +1 and hex rotations(vertical)

every print it does a full cycle of those transformations per base generated hex

so its not slow, its just that the output is slow, internally it does a lot of work for each base key

RUN:

`python3 find.py`

or

`python find.py`

or just

`find.py`



in case if this was useful to you, can you please donate BTC:
